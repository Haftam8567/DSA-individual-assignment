 Iterative Approach in algorthim:
An iterative approach solves a problem using loops like for, while, or do-while.

Recursive Approach in algorithm:
A recursive approach solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type and solving them via function calls to itself.
they have
Same time complexity (O(log n)), because they do the same amount of searching.

Recursive version uses more memory due to the call stack.
summary:
Both iterative and recursive binary search are fast — they take O(log n) time.

Iterative uses a loop, so it’s more memory-efficient (O(1) space).

Recursive uses function calls, so it needs extra memory (O(log n) space).

They do the same job, but iterative is usually better for saving memory.
